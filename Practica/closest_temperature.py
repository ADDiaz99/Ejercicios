Closest Temperature Codingame Puzzle
https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/temperatures

Rules
Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).
 	Game Input
    Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.

    Input

    Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze


    Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000
